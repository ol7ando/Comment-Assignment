                <p>Gelato Messina started in 2002 as just one store in sydney. As the business grew, the owner realised they needed accounting software that would grow with them</p>
                <p>When they expanded into the united states, using Xero meant their business patners and staff culd access the finance from anywhere at anytime</p>
                <p>convinience and ease of use were two of the main reason the founder Declan Lee turned to Xero</p>
                <p><q>a cloud based system is much more intuitive for people like us who are'nt really accountants, but know a little about accounting</q></p>

                    Life before Xero was pretty clunky.Xero is a cloud-based system and that's the most convinient thing about it. our business patners have always go access to the numbers
